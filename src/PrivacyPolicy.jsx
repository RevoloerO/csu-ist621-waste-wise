      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        Your privacy is important to us. It is WasteWise's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our website, http://wastewise.com, and other sites we own and operate.
      </p>
      <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
      <p>
        We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so ‚Äì for example, to provide our services, to communicate with you, or to make our services better.
      </p>
      <h3>1.1. Information you provide to us</h3>
      <p>
        It‚Äôs probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Basic account information:</strong> We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a WasteWise account to provide an email address along with a username or name.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Public profile information:</strong> If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile. For example, if you have a WasteWise account, your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, such as a photo or a bio.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Content information:</strong> Depending on the services you use, you may also provide us with information about you in draft and published content (such as for your website or your WasteWise profile). For example, if you write a blog post that includes biographic information about you, we will have that information, and so will anyone with access to the Internet, if you choose to publish the post publicly.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>2. How we use information</h2>
      <p>
        We use information about you as mentioned above and for the purposes listed below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide our services ‚Äì for example, to set up and maintain your account, host your website, or charge you for any of our paid services;</li>
        <li>To further develop our services ‚Äì for example by adding new features that we think our users will enjoy or will help them to create and manage their websites more efficiently;</li>
        <li>To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our services, which helps us improve our services and make them easier to use;</li>
        <li>To measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising, and better understand user retention and attrition ‚Äì for example, we may analyze how many individuals purchased a plan after receiving a marketing message or the features used by those who continue to use our services after a certain length of time;</li>
        <li>To monitor and prevent any problems with our services, protect the security of our services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of WasteWise and others, which may result in us declining a transaction or the use of our services;</li>
        <li>To communicate with you, for example through an email, about offers and promotions offered by WasteWise and others we think will be of interest to you, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date on WasteWise and our products; and</li>
        <li>To personalize your experience using our services, provide content recommendations, target our marketing messages to groups of our users (for example, those who have a particular plan with us or have been our user for a certain length of time), and serve relevant advertisements.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>3. Sharing information</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell our users‚Äô private personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
        We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors:</strong> We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our services or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Third-party vendors:</strong> We may share information about you with third-party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you. This group includes vendors that help us provide our services to you (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you, registrars, registries, and data escrow services that allow us to provide domain registration services, those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g., by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns), those that help us understand and enhance our services (like analytics providers), and companies that make products available on our websites (such as extensions). We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal and regulatory requirements:</strong> We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>To protect rights, property, and others:</strong> We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of WasteWise, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Business transfers:</strong> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that WasteWise goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information, and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>With your consent:</strong> We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Aggregated or de-identified information:</strong> We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our services, or share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>4. Security</h2>
      <p>
        While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as monitoring our services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.
      </p>
      <h2>5. Choices</h2>
      <p>
        You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Limit the information that you provide:</strong> If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our services ‚Äì for example, paid themes ‚Äì may not be accessible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Opt-out of electronic communications:</strong> You may opt out of receiving promotional messages from us. Just follow the instructions in those messages. If you opt out of promotional messages, we may still send you other messages, like those about your account and legal notices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Set your browser to reject cookies:</strong> At this time, WasteWise does not respond to ‚Äúdo not track‚Äù signals across all of our services.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Close your account:</strong> While we‚Äôd be very sad to see you go, if you no longer want to use our services üôÅ üôÅ üôÅ, you can close your WasteWise account.
